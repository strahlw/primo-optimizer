# PRIMO - The P&A Project Optimizer Toolkit

PRIMO - The P&A Project Optimizer Toolkit aims to provide multi-scale, simulation-based, open source
computational tools and models to support the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) and the National
Emissions Reduction Initiative (NEMRI).

## Getting Started

Our complete documentation is currently being built, but here is a summarized set of steps to get started using the framework.

While not required, we encourage the installation of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and using the `conda` command to create a separate python environment in which to install the PRIMO Toolkit.

Use conda to create a new "primo-env" (could be any name you like) environment then activate that environment:
```bash
conda create --name primo-env python
conda activate primo-env
```

Install all dependencies with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For developers, install dependencies with:
```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

For users interested in using the free solver SCIP to solve PRIMO's optimization problems, please run:
```
conda install -c conda-forge -y scip=9.1.0
```

To test the installation of the primo package, execute:
```
pytest primo\utils\tests\test_imports.py
```
The above test, if executed successfully, confirms that primo package is now installed and available in the "primo-env" package that was just created. 

To use the utilities implemented in the PRIMO package that query the U.S. Census API and Bing Maps API, appropriate API keys must be obtained
by signing up with the respective services. These keys must be configured in a .env file in the parent directory. For more details, please see:
[API Keys](https://primo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/method/api_keys.html)

Users can also employ other commercial solvers, for example Gurobi, to solve the optimization problem. 
However, users are responsible for configuring and setting up these solvers themselves

General, background and overview information is available at the [NEMRI website](https://edx.netl.doe.gov/nemri/).
